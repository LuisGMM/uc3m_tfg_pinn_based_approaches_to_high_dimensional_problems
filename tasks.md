## Weekly tasks

### Week 1

- Create a NN to approximate f(x)=cos(nx)
- Create a NN to approximate something with more dimensions (i.e. f(x, y)=x^2 + y^2)

### Week 2

- Add a variable learning rate to reduce the learing rate as the loss decreases
- Explore whether it is possible to use at each epoch a different subset (maybe
a randomnly and uniformly distributed) of the training data.
- Try to do the above with a function in higher dimensions, that is, maybe a
paraboloid with multiple inputs
f(r, s, t, u, v, w) = r*s + cos(t) + sin(2u) + v^3 + exp^w
- Learn to differentiate the output of the nn with respect to the different inputs
